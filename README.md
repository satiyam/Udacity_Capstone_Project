# Requirements
The Jupyter Notebook is written in Python (3.x. version required).

This project requires you to install the listed libraries in the requirement.txt file and Anaconda distribution Python 3.6

The main packages used are:

numpy: scientific computing tools

pandas: data structures and data analysis tools

matplotlib: data visualisation tools

seaborn: data visualisation tools

scikit-learn (sklearn): Machine Learning library in Python

imblearn: Open source, MIT-licensed library relying on scikit-learn (imported as sklearn) and provides tools when dealing with 
classification with imbalanced classes.

sagemaker: Open source library for training and deploying machine learning models on Amazon SageMaker.

boto3: AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to create, configure, and manage AWS services


# Results
The Gradient Boosting Tree Model developed scored an accuracy of 96% on test dataset.
