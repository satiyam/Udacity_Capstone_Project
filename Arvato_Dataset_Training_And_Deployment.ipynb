    "# Part 2: Supervised Learning Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've found which parts of the population are more likely to be customers of the mail-order company, it's time to build a prediction model. Each of the rows in the \"MAILOUT\" data files represents an individual that was targeted for a mailout campaign. Ideally, we should be able to use the demographic information from each individual to decide whether or not it will be worth it to include that person in the campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"MAILOUT\" data has been split into two approximately equal parts, each with almost 43 000 data rows. In this part, you can verify your model with the \"TRAIN\" partition, which includes a column, \"RESPONSE\", that states whether or not a person became a customer of the company following the campaign. In the next part, you'll need to create predictions on the \"TEST\" partition, where the \"RESPONSE\" column has been withheld."

    "\n",

    "Here are the observations we can make about the results:\n",
    "1. Linear Support Vector Machines/Linear Learner model work in this scenario but they work best where the features present are of high dimensionality. In this case, LinearSVC overtrains and predicts well on the training dataset but fails on the test dataset. Additionally, the training algorithmn also converges slowly, thus indicating it's lack of fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Naive Bayes classifier assumes predictors are independent and can be trained on less training data. However, in this context the classifier did not perform well due to dependencies within the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ensemble method such as RandomForests performed well but it is prone to overfitting on the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. GradientBoosted Trees with a learning rate of 0.1, optimum trees of 60 and a depth of 9, with a subsample less than 1 (undergoes Stochastic Gradient Descent) reduces variances but increases bias. Varying this parameter would allow users to find an optimal convergence.\n",
